1. write a PL/SQL ‘EXCEP_02292_PROC’ that declares an exception for the Oracle Server error ORA-02292 (integrity constraint violated – child record found). The block tests for the exception and outputs the error message. 
a.    In the declarative section, declare an exception e_childrecord_exists. Associate the declared exception with the standard Oracle Server error –02292. 
b.    In the executable section, display “Deleting department 40....” Include a DELETE statement to delete the department with the department_id 40. 
c.    Include an exception section to handle the e_childrecord_exists exception and display the appropriate message
d. Add comments (--) to explain the reason for exception handling in your own words

SOLUTION:

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
--delarative section
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE EXCEP_02292_PROC IS
e_childrecord_exists EXCEPTION;
cnt_dept NUMBER(15);
PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(e_childrecord_exists,-02292);

--executable section
BEGIN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleting department 40....');
SELECT COUNT(*) INTO cnt_dept FROM employees WHERE department_id = 40;
IF (cnt_dept > 0) THEN
RAISE e_childrecord_exists;
ELSE 
DELETE departments WHERE department_id=40;
END IF;
EXCEPTION
WHEN e_childrecord_exists THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('CHILD RECORD FOUND');
END;
/
EXEC EXCEP_02292_PROC;

/* THERE IS CHILD RECORD EXISTS IN THE EMPLOYEES TABLE WHERE DEPARTMENT ID = 40 SO CAN'T ABLE ABLE TO DELETE THE 
PARENT RECORD IN DEPARTMENT TABLE */
